## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is the first HNG 13 task for the frontend track

## The challenge

### Responsiveness
Card must look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
On small screens, stack content vertically; on wider screens, arrange avatar to the left and text to the right (or any clean layout).
Use CSS that doesnâ€™t break layout when content length changes (word-wrap,truncation with accessible expansion, etc.)

### Behavior / Implementation guidance
The time in milliseconds should be accurate and reflect Date.now() at render or on an update tick if you choose to update it, do so reasonably.
Avatar should accept either a URL or an uploaded image (if upload used, thecomponent must ultimately display an image URL).
Social links should open in a new tab (target="_blank") with rel="noopenernoreferrer".
Use semantic markup and modern CSS (Flexbox or Grid).
